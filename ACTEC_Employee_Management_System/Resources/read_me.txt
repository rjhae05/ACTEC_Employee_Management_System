🖼️ Resources/

Description:
The Resources/ folder stores all static files used by the application such as images, icons, logos, and other media assets.
These resources help provide a consistent and visually appealing interface across all forms and controls.

Purpose:

Centralize all UI-related assets in one folder.

Make it easier to update branding or theme elements (like logos and icons).

Improve project organization by separating design assets from code files.

Typical Contents:

File								Description
logo.png						  |	Application or company logo used in forms like Login or Dashboard.
icons/ (optional subfolder)		  |	Folder for small icons used in buttons, menus, and toolbars.
backgrounds/ (optional subfolder) |	Images for form backgrounds or splash screens.

Best Practices:

Use consistent naming conventions for files (e.g., icon_user.png, bg_login.jpg).

Keep image file sizes small to optimize app performance.

Store only non-sensitive assets (avoid personal data or licensed content).

Access resources via My.Resources for better management within VB.NET.
