STEP-BY-STEP: PUSH OR UPDATE PROJECT TO GITHUB
  
  🧩 1️⃣ Navigate to your project folder
  
  Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and go to your project folder:
  
  cd "local_path\ACTEC_Employee_Management_System"
  
  ⚙️ 2️⃣ Check if Git is initialized
  git status
  
  
  If it says “not a git repository”, then initialize:
  
  git init
  
  🔗 3️⃣ Add your remote (if not added yet)
  
  Only do this once:
  
  git remote add origin https://github.com/rjhae05/ACTEC_Employee_Management_System.git
  
  
  If you already added it before, you can skip this step or confirm:
  
  git remote -v
  
  📦 4️⃣ Add all new or changed files
  git add .
  
  🧾 5️⃣ Commit the changes
  
  For first push:
  
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  
  
  For updating (e.g., you edited files):
  
  git commit -m "Updated UI and backend structure"
  
  🚀 6️⃣ Push to GitHub
  
  If this is your first push (no branch yet):
  
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  
  
  If you already have pushed before (just an update):
  
  git push
